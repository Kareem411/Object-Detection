# Object Detection

This repository contains a Python script for performing object detection using YOLOv5 and OpenCV. The script allows you to detect objects in either a camera or a video feed, and you can also choose to use a mask to apply the detection only to specific areas.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) (already included in the repository)
- OpenCV
- CVZone

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/object-detection.git`


2. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Run the script:
`python Car_Counter_test.py`


4. Follow the prompts to choose between a camera or a video feed, select a mask (if desired), and choose whether to check for specific objects.
