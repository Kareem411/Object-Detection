# Object Detection

Welcome to this repository featuring a Python script for performing object detection using YOLOv5/YOLOv8 and OpenCV. The script allows you to detect objects in real-time through either a camera or a video feed. Enhance the detection accuracy by selecting an appropriate confidence threshold to optimize the results. Enjoy the simplicity and effectiveness of this tool for precise and efficient object detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv5/YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics) (already included in the repository)
- OpenCV
- CVZone
- Pytorch with Cuda supported GPU

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/object-detection.git`


2. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Run the script:
`python Land_Vehicles_Detector.py`


4. Kindly proceed by selecting either a camera or a video feed based on your preference. Then, choose a confidence threshold to optimize the results. Once you've made your selections, please proceed with the execution.
